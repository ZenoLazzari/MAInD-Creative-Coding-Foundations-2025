Starting from the concept of a pinboard, implement a web page that:

- is responsive (properly layout for smartphone, tablet, and desktop)
- allows the user to add and remove elements
- allows the user to coustomize elements (i.e. colors, size)
- allows the switch between two views (at least)

Short project description:
Interactive web app where users can create their custom hamburger by selecting or adding ingredients. Each ingredient can be edited, deleted, or categorized (e.g., spicy, vegan). The interface is responsive, featuring dynamic list/grid views and animated visual feedback.

Function List

1. updateCounter()

Arguments: none

Description: Calculates how many ingredients have been added to the chosenIngredients list. Dynamically updates the text inside the ingredientCounter element to display the current number of selected ingredients out of six maximum.

Returns: void (does not return a value; only updates the UI).

2. addIngredientToBox(name)

Arguments: name (string) — the name of the ingredient to be added.

Description:
Creates a new li element containing:

the ingredient name,

a dropdown select menu to choose a type (Normal, Spicy, Vegan, Important) that changes the background color,

an “Edit” button that lets the user rename the ingredient using a prompt(),

a “Delete” button that removes the ingredient from the list and updates the counter.
If the total number of ingredients exceeds six, an alert message appears and no new ingredient is added.

Returns: void

3. addIngredient()

Arguments: none

Description:
Retrieves the value entered by the user in the #newIngredient input field. If the value is not empty, it passes it to addIngredientToBox(name) to add it to the custom burger list, then clears the input field.

Returns: void

4. toggleAvailableView() (triggered by an event listener)

Arguments: none

Description:
Toggles the CSS class grid-view on the #availableIngredients list, switching between list and grid display modes. Also updates the button text to show either “Grid View” or “List View” depending on the current layout.

Returns: void
